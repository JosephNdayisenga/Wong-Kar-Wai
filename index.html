                <h3 class = "headline">Early life and career beginnings:</h3>
                <li><strong>1958</strong> - Born in Shanghai, China</li>
                <li><strong>1963</strong> - the seeds of the Cultural Revolution were beginning to take effect in China and his parents decided to relocate to British-ruled Hong Kong. The two older children were meant to join them later, but the borders closed before they had a chance and Wong did not see his brother or sister again for ten years.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - Earned a diploma in graphic design from Hong Kong Polytechnic.</li>
                <li><strong>1987</strong> - Spent two years co-writing the screenplay for Patrick Tam's action film "Final Victory", for which he was nominated at the 7th Hong Kong Film Awards.</li>
                <h3 class = "headline">Developing Style:</h3>
                <li><strong>1990</strong> - Decided to move away from the crime trend in Hong Kong cinema, to which he felt indifferent. He was eager to make something more unusual. He directed "Days of being wild".The film earned little at the box office and divided critics.</li>
                <li><strong>1994</strong> - Released "Ashes of time". The film was a commercial failure, but critics were generally appreciative of Wong's "refusal to be loyal to the wuxia genre". The film won several local awards, and competed at the Venice Film Festival where Christopher Doyle won Best Cinematography.</li>
                <li><strong>1995</strong> - <i>Chungking Express</i>. During the long production of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break as he waited for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: "I thought I should do something to make myself feel comfortable about making films again. So I made Chungking Express, which I made like a student film."</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong> - Wong continued to work without break, expanding his ideas from <i>Chungking Express</i> into another film about alienated young adults in contemporary Hong Kong. Chungking had originally been conceived as three stories, but when time ran out Wong developed the third as a new project instead: "Fallen Angels".</li>
                <h3 class = "headline">Widespead Recognition:</h3>
                <li><strong>1997</strong> - While his reputation grew steadily throughout the early 1990s, Wong's international standing was "thoroughly consolidated" with the 1997 romantic drama <i>Happy Together</i>. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where Wong became Hong Kong's first winner of the Best Director Award (an achievement he downplayed: "it makes no difference, it’s just something you can put on an ad.")</li>
                <li><strong>2000</strong> - Wong directed <i> In The Mood for Love</i>. The film emerged from a highly complicated production history that lasted two years.</li>
                <h3 class = "headline">Commercial success:</h3>
                <li><strong>2004</strong> - While <i>In The Mood For Love</i> took two years to complete, its sequel – <i>2046</i> – took double that time.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> - <i>My Blueberry Nights</i>. Following the difficult production of "2046", Wong wanted his next feature to be a simple, invigorating experience. He decided to make an English-language film in America, later justifying this by explaining: "It’s a new landscape. It’s a new background, so it’s refreshing."</li>
                <li><strong>2013</strong> - Wong's next film was not released for five years, as he underwent another long and difficult production on <i>The Grandmaster</i> – a biopic of the martial arts teacher Ip Man.</li>
                <h3 class = "headline">International Recognition</h3>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> - <i>Variety</i> named Wong an icon of arthouse cinema.</li>
                <li><strong>2018</strong> - Wong was awarded the Doctor of Arts degree by Harvard University.</li>
            </ul>
